  # Sprinting knockback values. This multipliers will be used if the damager is sprinting
  # By default in Minecraft, if the damager player is sprinting, he deals more knockback to the damaged one.
  # This is the reason of PvP movement-related actions like W-tapping.
  sprinting:
    # Select the sprinting module system. Available values: "standard" and "legacy".
    # "standard" is the new module that will improve the sprinting detection (better detection)
    # "legacy" is the old method (pre v2.10.0) that you may find better if you started with a version below 2.10.0.
    # If you set "legacy" as method, you should set the "knockback.air.horizontal" multiplier to 1.0 to achieve the exact same
    # as version 2.9 and below.
